# Bank-Telephone-Sales
Introduction
We made a Classification model to classify bank customers into two groups, customers who are more likely to accept a term deposit offer through call and customers who are less likely to.

“Time” and “Energy” are limited, so any group aims to use them efficiently. Banks are also trying to find the best way to use them efficiently. This project aims to help banks maximize their time-and-energy efficiency by providing a customer group classifier. The classifier would distinguish customers with high probabilities of signing up for a term deposit from customers with low probabilities and let banks know which customer group they should put effort into.

To optimize marketing resource utilization and improve campaign efficiency, the banks want to know:

Among its clients, who would be more likely to purchase a term deposit product and thus worth continual promotion effort (give phone call in this case)?
What are the critical factors that affect the decision to purchase a term deposit? How can the bank make improvement in these aspects to increase the success rate of purchase?
